Proposed to stop using \verb~provided~ in dependency scopes to prevent manual dependency upload to the container\\
Introduced ELK\\
Proposed a new approach in determining expected timings for login into chat using normalization to the speed of light\\
Performed load tests using Tsung, Jmeter, own load test scripts. Found bottleneck in Jmeter\\
By indirect evidences made an assumption the Customer experiences problems because they intercept and substitute SSL certificates. Made a laboratory stand and checked with developers. Later, the Customer confirmed they did not put their self-signed CA to their device\\
